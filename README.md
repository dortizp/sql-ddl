# DDL - Time Tracker

It's common among high-performing teams to worry about the amount of time each team member is spending on their projects. At the beginning of each project, the project manager makes an assessment and tries to calculate how many hours each member will invest in it, creating a budget for the project. The problem is that, with multiple projects running in parallel and with each team member assigned to multiple projects, it is difficult to know if the proposed budget is correct.

It was decided to start tracking how many hours a day each member spends on each project and store that information in a database for more detailed analysis.

Do each exercise to begin to help solve this problem.
